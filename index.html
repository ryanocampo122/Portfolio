            <p> I am Ryan Ocampo. I have an immense love for technology, a passion that has only grown over the years. My journey began with a curiosity with tech, exploring the vast world of programming and development. Over time, this curiosity evolved into a genuine enthusiasm for creating meaningful, interactive experiences, particularly in the realm of video game development.
                As a student, I am driven to deepen my understanding of technology, continually seeking to expand my skills and expertise. Every challenge is an opportunity to grow, and I approach each new project with a commitment to excellence and a determination to push the boundaries of what I can achieve. My ultimate goal is to build engaging and innovative video games that captivate audiences and make an impact in the world of interactive entertainment.
                I am excited to continue learning, experimenting, and evolving as a developer while striving to make my mark in the video game industry.
