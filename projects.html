                        This project is a health and fitness application designed to help users visualize and track their fitness progress in an engaging and interactive way. The core feature of the app is the ability to visualize muscle groups on a human body model, 
                        with muscles dynamically changing their redness based on the exercises logged by the user. The app offers a seamless experience, allowing users to input their workout routines, track exercises, and see real-time feedback on muscle engagement.\

                        In this projet, I also played the project lead. Ensuring key features of the project were met, such as the ability to visualize muscle groups on a human body model, and the ability to track exercises. I also largely contributed to the design and art of the project. 
                        Using my front end skills to design and implement the body map dynmically changing and providing a user clean interface.
