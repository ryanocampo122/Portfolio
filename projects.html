                    <p>FeltKnight is a top down 2D action video game. Featuring a unique art style and engaging combat. In FeltKnight, you ward off against different enemies, each equipped with their own unique abilities. Potion drops give you powers 
                        to defeat your foes. The game offers a dynamic and engaging experience, with a focus on creative gameplay and innovative mechanics. These mechanics include unique abilities, dynamic combat, and enemy encounters.

                        In this project, I programmed the enemy behaviour and designed and animated the heavy enemy design. I also maintained the project in the GitLab repo, making sure everything was properly merged using standard git procedures.

                        This project is a health and fitness application designed to help users visualize and track their fitness progress in an engaging and interactive way. The core feature of the app is the ability to visualize muscle groups on a human body model, 
                        with muscles dynamically changing their redness based on the exercises logged by the user. The app offers a seamless experience, allowing users to input their workout routines, track exercises, and see real-time feedback on muscle engagement.\

                        In this projet, I also played the project lead. Ensuring key features of the project were met, such as the ability to visualize muscle groups on a human body model, and the ability to track exercises. I also largely contributed to the design and art of the project. 
                        Using my front end skills to design and implement the body map dynmically changing and providing a user clean interface.
