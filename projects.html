                        This project is a custom-built data analysis and visualization tool created using Python. Its core function is to take the complex outputs of machine learning models and present them in a clear, intuitive way. The tool helps in assessing model performance by plotting predicted versus actual values and displaying key performance metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). A key feature is the Feature Importance pie chart, which provides valuable insights into which input variables most influence the model's predictions. As the creator of this tool, I was responsible for the full-stack development, from back-end data processing with machine learning models to front-end visualization. The project demonstrates my skills in Python, data science, and my ability to develop solutions that bridge the gap between complex technology and user-friendly applications.

                        Designed and implemented a low-level client–server application in C, focused on efficient network communication and robust request handling. The server was built using POSIX sockets and follows a structured request–response model, allowing multiple clients to connect, send requests, and receive processed responses over TCP. The project involved implementing socket creation, binding, listening, and connection handling, as well as parsing incoming client messages and returning appropriate responses. Particular attention was paid to memory management, buffer handling, and error checking to ensure stability and prevent common issues such as buffer overflows, resource leaks, and undefined behavior. To support concurrent client connections, the server architecture was designed with scalability in mind, using techniques such as process forking or multiplexing (e.g., select/poll) to manage multiple active sockets efficiently. Logging and graceful shutdown mechanisms were also implemented to ensure clean resource deallocation and predictable server behavior under load.Designed and implemented a low-level client–server application in C, focused on efficient network communication and robust request handling.

                         Developed a machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to analyze public sentiment surrounding crime in Canadian Prairie cities and examine how emotional responses vary across seasonal and extreme weather conditions. This project supports interdisciplinary research investigating the relationship between climate variability, crime patterns, and public perception in urban environments. The system ingests large-scale, publicly available social media data from platforms such as Reddit and X (Twitter), collected using crime-related keywords (e.g., theft, assault, violence) and geolocation filters for Saskatoon, Regina, Winnipeg, and Edmonton. Text data is preprocessed using standard NLP techniques including tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization, and handling informal language commonly found in online discourse. Sentiment classification models were implemented to quantify emotional responses such as fear, anger, concern, and neutrality in crime-related discussions. Lexicon-based approaches (VADER) were used for baseline sentiment scoring, while transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) were applied for contextual sentiment classification. Model outputs were temporally aligned with climate variables (temperature extremes, seasonal shifts, severe weather events) and crime occurrence data to enable comparative and longitudinal analysis. Machine learning results were aggregated at daily and monthly resolutions to identify shifts in public sentiment before, during, and after extreme weather events. These sentiment trends were then correlated with observed crime patterns to explore whether climate-induced environmental stressors coincide with heightened public concern or perceived insecurity.Developed a machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to analyze public sentiment surrounding crime in Canadian Prairie cities and examine how emotional responses vary across seasonal and extreme weather conditions.

                        This project is a sophisticated data visualization tool built in Python, designed to help users explore and understand a large dataset of movies released between 1950 and 2019. The centerpiece of the application is an interactive heat map that provides a quick,  high-level overview of the data. However, the true power of the tool lies in its robust filter system, which allows for a deep and personalized analysis of the dataset. Users can dynamically filter the movies based on several key criteria: language, to explore films from specific regions; content, to distinguish between TV shows and movies; and genre, to narrow the focus to areas of interest like drama, comedy, or action. Additionally, the tool utilizes a color scale on the heat map to represent the IMDB rating, providing an immediate visual reference for a movie's popularity and critical reception. This project highlights my proficiency in Python and data science libraries, demonstrating my ability to transform raw data into a clean, insightful, and interactive visual format that empowers users to derive their own conclusions.

                       Developed a full-featured PowerShell GUI application to streamline common Tier 1–2 IT support workflows in an enterprise Active Directory environment. The tool centralizes user, device, and network diagnostics into a single Windows Forms interface, reducing reliance on manual command-line queries and significantly improving support efficiency for helpdesk staff. The application integrates directly with Active Directory to retrieve user and account information, identify currently logged-on users, check lockout status, unlock accounts, and perform password resets while enforcing password changes at next login. It also supports remote device diagnostics using WMI/CIM, allowing technicians to quickly view hardware specifications, operating system details, Windows build versions, disk free space, and network configuration without physically accessing the machine. Network-aware logic maps IP address ranges to physical or organizational locations, providing immediate context for geographically distributed assets.To support broader operational needs, the tool includes functionality for monitoring multiple computers simultaneously, visually indicating online and offline status, inspecting installed software inventories, viewing running processes, and listing historical user profiles on a device. Robust error handling, connectivity checks, and clear UI feedback were implemented to ensure reliability in real-world enterprise conditions.Developed a full-featured PowerShell GUI application to streamline common Tier 1–2 IT support workflows in an enterprise Active Directory environment.

                        FitLog is a health and fitness application designed to help users visualize and track their fitness progress in an engaging and interactive way. The app's core feature is its ability to visualize muscle groups on a human body model, with muscles dynamically changing their redness based on the exercises logged by the user. The app offers a seamless experience, allowing users to input workout routines, track exercises, and see real-time feedback on muscle engagement. As the project lead, I ensured that key features were met, such as the ability to visualize muscle groups on the human body model and the ability to track exercises. I was also a significant contributor to the design and art of the project, using my front-end skills to design and implement the dynamically changing body map and provide users with a clean interface.

                        This project is a high-energy, local two-player video game that fuses fast-paced platforming with competitive mini-games. The core objective is for two players to race across dynamic maps, utilizing unique abilities to outmaneuver each other and reach the finish line. The gameplay is broken up by a variety of short, chaotic mini-games that add a layer of unpredictability and strategic fun between races. As the team lead, I oversaw the full development cycle. Coordinating asset creation, gameplay design, and feature integration to ensure a polished and cohesive experience. I worked closely with programmers, artists, and testers to maintain strong collaboration, enforce clear design standards, and ensure each sprint delivers meaningful enhancements. My focus is on balancing competitive mechanics with accessible controls, fostering a game that is equally thrilling for casual players and skilled competitors. Through iterative prototyping and continuous feedback, I guided the team toward a final product that is visually engaging, and consistently fun to play.
