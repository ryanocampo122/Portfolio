                    <p>FeltKnight is a top-down, 2D action video game featuring a unique art style and engaging combat. You face off against different enemies, each equipped with their own unique abilities, while potion drops give you powers to defeat your foes. The game offers a dynamic and engaging experience with a focus on creative gameplay and innovative mechanics.

                        For this project, I programmed the enemy behavior and designed and animated the heavy enemy. I also maintained the project in the GitLab repository, ensuring proper merging using standard Git procedures.

                        FitLog is a health and fitness application designed to help users visualize and track their fitness progress in an engaging and interactive way. The app's core feature is its ability to visualize muscle groups on a human body model, with muscles dynamically changing their redness based on the exercises logged by the user. The app offers a seamless experience, allowing users to input workout routines, track exercises, and see real-time feedback on muscle engagement.

                        As the project lead, I ensured that key features were met, such as the ability to visualize muscle groups on the human body model and the ability to track exercises. I was also a significant contributor to the design and art of the project, using my front-end skills to design and implement the dynamically changing body map and provide users with a clean interface.

                        This project is a custom-built data analysis and visualization tool created using Python. Its core function is to take the complex outputs of machine learning models and present them in a clear, intuitive way. The tool helps in assessing model performance by plotting predicted versus actual values and displaying key performance metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). A key feature is the Feature Importance pie chart, which provides valuable insights into which input variables most influence the model's predictions.

                        As the creator of this tool, I was responsible for the full-stack development, from back-end data processing with machine learning models to front-end visualization. The project demonstrates my skills in Python, data science, and my ability to develop solutions that bridge the gap between complex technology and user-friendly applications.

                        This project is a sophisticated data visualization tool built in Python, designed to help users explore and understand a large dataset of movies released between 1950 and 2019. The centerpiece of the application is an interactive heat map that provides a quick, 
                        high-level overview of the data. However, the true power of the tool lies in its robust filter system, which allows for a deep and personalized analysis of the dataset. Users can dynamically filter the movies based on several key criteria: language, to explore films from specific regions; content, to distinguish between TV shows and movies; and genre, to narrow the focus to areas of interest like drama, comedy, or action. Additionally, the tool utilizes a color scale on the heat map to represent the IMDB rating, providing an immediate visual reference for a movie's popularity and critical reception. This project highlights my proficiency in Python and data science libraries, demonstrating my ability to transform raw data into a clean, 
                        insightful, and interactive visual format that empowers users to derive their own conclusions.

                        This project is a high-energy, local multiplayer video game that fuses fast-paced platforming with competitive mini-games. The core objective is for two players to race across dynamic maps, utilizing unique abilities to outmaneuver each other and reach the finish line. The gameplay is broken up by a variety of short, chaotic mini-games that add a layer of unpredictability and strategic fun between races. As the developer, I was responsible for designing and implementing the core mechanics, including the distinct player abilities, the mini-game logic, and the level design for multiple maps. This project demonstrates my skills in game design, creating a balanced and engaging local competitive experience, and developing a cohesive game that offers both a challenge and entertaining variety.
